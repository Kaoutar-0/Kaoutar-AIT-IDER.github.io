        <p class="para">Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – 
            all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.
            Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest
            planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other
             planets combined.Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold,
            windy clouds  of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.
             Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that
              has raged for hundreds of years.</p>

            Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got big enough to start burning.
            Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years.
            Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth. 
            Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.</p>
