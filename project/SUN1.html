        <P class="para">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.
            It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to
            incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, 
            radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet 
            light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important
            source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39
            million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth.
            Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and it accounts 
           for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
            Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen
             (~73%), the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller 
            quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.</P>

            The Sun is a star. There are lots of stars in the universe, 
            but the Sun is the closest one to Earth, and it’s the only one in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system.
            
            The Sun is a hot ball of glowing gases. It keeps our
             planet warm enough for living things to grow. It gives us light so we can see.
            
            The planets orbit the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
             Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris also orbit the Sun.</p>
