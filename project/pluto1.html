        <p class="para">Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt,
             a donut-shaped region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.
            There may be millions of these icy objects, collectively referred 
            to as Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs),
             in this distant region of our solar system.
            Pluto – which is smaller than Earth’s Moon – has a heart-shaped glacier 
            that’s the size of Texas and Oklahoma. This fascinating world has blue 
            skies, spinning moons, mountains as high as the Rockies, and it snows – 
            but the snow is red.</p>

        <p class="pluto">Pluto is the only world (so far) named by an 11-year-old girl. In 1930,
             Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, suggested to her grandfather that the new discovery be named for the Roman god of the underworld. He forwarded the name to the Lowell Observatory and it was selected.
            Pluto's moons are named for other mythological figures associated with the underworld. Charon is named for the river Styx boatman who ferries souls in the underworld (as well as honoring Sharon, the wife of discoverer James Christy); Nix is named for the mother of Charon, who is also the goddess of darkness and night; Hydra is named for the nine-headed serpent that guards the underworld; Kerberos is named after the three-headed dog of Greek mythology (and called Fluffy in the Harry Potter novels), and Styx is named for the mythological river
             that separates the world of the living from the realm of the dead.</p>
