        <p class="para">Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.
            While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. 
            Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
            The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>

            Storytellers explore the nature of our planet and possible alternate realities in many books, movies, and television shows. The iconic film "Planet of the Apes" (and its sequels) takes place in a future in which astronauts "discover" a planet inhabited by highly intelligent apes and primitive humans, only to realize later, much to their dismay, that  it was Earth all along.
            <br>
            In the long-running and re-booted television series "Battlestar Galactica" – tired survivors of a war with highly evolved robots called Cylons are on a quest to find Earth, a long-lost colony.
            <br>
            In other stories, Earth has been abandoned or destroyed, such as in the Joss Whedon series "Firefly," or the book and its film adaptation "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." In the animated feature "Titan A.E." – Earth has been destroyed by an alien species, but a well-placed planet builder recreates it and all the species that live on it.</p>
